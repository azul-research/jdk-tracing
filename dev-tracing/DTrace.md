# DTrace

DTrace is available for Mac OS X, FreeBSD, and the Solaris family of operating systems: Solaris 10, Oracle Solaris 11, SmartOS, OmniOS, and anything else based on the illumos kernel. DTrace has its own language called ```D``` (not the [D language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_(programming_language)), there names are similiar but they are two different languages). It is based on ```C``` with additions of tracing specialised functions.
